## Algorithm
Start the program.

Input the graph as a 2D adjacency matrix graph[V][V], where V is the number of vertices.

Choose the starting vertex s.

Generate a list vertex[] of all vertices except the starting vertex.

Use itertools.permutations to generate all possible orderings of vertices.

Initialize min_path = âˆž.

For each permutation:

Compute the total path weight starting from s, visiting all vertices in the permutation, and returning to s.

Update min_path if the computed path weight is smaller.

Return min_path as the minimum cost of the TSP.

Print the result.

Stop the program.  

## Program:

        for j in i: 
            current_pathweight += graph[k][j] 
            k = j 
        current_pathweight += graph[k][s] 
        min_path = min(min_path, current_pathweight) 
         
    return min_path
   
 
 

if __name__ == "__main__":
    graph = [[0, 10, 15, 20], [10, 0, 35, 25],
            [15, 35, 0, 30], [20, 25, 30, 0]]
    s = 0

## Result:
Thus the program was executed successfully for finding the minimum cost to vist all cities.
